|<a id=“キーセンド“></a>キーセンド|  Key Send  |  Key Send is a proposed feature for the Lightning Network which would allow payers to pay receivers over the Lightning Network, without needing an invoice from the receiver. Instead of sending an invoice each time a payer wishes to send bitcoin to a receiver, the receiver could share their node ID (a public key) once, allowing the payer to pay any amount at any time in the future without further interaction.Key Send would greatly improve the usability of Lightning by eliminating several steps in the payment flow. Currently, in order to receive a payment, a user must send their counterparty an invoice, requesting a specific amount of bitcoin to be sent to them. This is inconvenient for several reasons, including bandwidth and the several interactions between payer and receiver needed to execute a payment.  |  1,000 sats  |
|<a id=“カンティロン効果“></a>カンティロン効果 |Cantillon Effect | The Cantillon Effect describes the uneven effect inflation has on goods and assets in an economy. Since new fiat money is injected into an economy at specific points, its effects are felt by different people and industries at different times. This causes a distortion in relative prices and benefits certain parties while disadvantaging others. When new money is added to the economy, it will naturally raise the price of goods and assets. However, not all prices will rise by the same amount or at the same time. The Cantillon Effect asserts that the first recipient of the new supply of money has an arbitrage opportunity of being able to spend money before prices have increased. This is partially due to the fact that new fiat money is created at almost zero cost and given to specific parties, usually banks. These banks have an opportunity to spend this money on goods and assets whose price has not yet reflected the increase in money supply. Banks can thus buy goods at a discounted rate. As the new money flows from central banks to private banks to investors to ordinary citizens, prices gradually begin to reflect the increase in the money supply. By the time ordinary citizens experience the increased money supply, they will be buying goods at higher prices. Thus, the flow of new money through the economy is beneficial to parties that receive the funds first, and less beneficial to those that receive it later on. The individuals and institutions closest to the central bank – banks and asset owners – are granted financial advantages at the cost of those least connected to the financial system. As a result of the Cantillon Effect, inflation can be seen as a non-legislative and regressive tax on the purchasing power of citizens by the government.| |
|<a id=“コインベース・トランザクション“></a>コインベース・トランザクション |Coinbase Transaction |A coinbase transaction is the first transaction in each block. The coinbase transaction distributes the block subsidy, which is currently 6.25 BTC per block, and also collects the cumulative fees of all transactions in the block. Since this transaction is creating new bitcoin, the coinbase transaction is valid without any inputs. To see an example, check out this coinbase transaction in Block #650,000 on Blockstream: there will be no inputs, and the single output will be of the amount 6.25 BTC plus the 0.244131 BTC of fees the miner collected. ||
|<a id=“コインジョイン“></a>コインジョイン | CoinJoin|A CoinJoin is a large Bitcoin transaction which takes inputs from many different users and returns many outputs of identical amounts, so that an observer cannot easily determine which outputs belong to which of the participants. CoinJoin provides increased privacy for owners of bitcoin by breaking the heuristics used by chain analysis companies. CoinJoin transactions obscure ownership of specific pieces of bitcoin (UTXOs). CoinJoin is distinct from mixing services in that CoinJoin operators never take custody of any funds. Users maintain control of their bitcoin at all times. Check out an example of a CoinJoin transaction on the blockchain here. In order to construct a CoinJoin transaction, users cooperatively contribute inputs to a transaction and receive the same amounts of bitcoin as outputs, all in uniform amounts. For example, if 5 users input amounts of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 BTC, there will be five inputs totalling 15 BTC, and there will be 15 outputs, each worth 1 BTC. Since each input is of exactly the same amount, it is impossible to tell which 1 BTC outputs belong to which user. ||
|<a id=“コインスワップ“></a>コインスワップ |CoinSwap |CoinSwap is a proposed method for making Bitcoin transactions more private. Currently, chain analysis relies heavily on the assumption that if Alice sends an entire UTXO to an address, she is sending the transaction to herself. CoinSwap undermines this assumption by allowing two parties to send entire UTXOs to new addresses which are not their own. In doing so, parties will swap UTXOs and break the chain of custody for both coins. <br>While a CoinSwap is composed of on-chain transactions, CoinSwap is an off-chain coordination protocol, and it would not require any changes to Bitcoin’s protocol. All interactions between the two parties would take place over the internet, and normal Bitcoin transactions would be posted to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, CoinSwap is still in its nascent phase, and has not been widely implemented or adopted. ||
|<a id=“コールドストレージ“></a>コールドストレージ |Cold Storage |Cold storage describes any method of storing data which does not connect to the internet or any other devices. A cold wallet is a form of cold storage often used by bitcoiners to protect bitcoin which they do not plan on moving frequently.<br>A wallet is considered a cold wallet if the private keys are kept on a device isolated from the internet. However, the public keys of a cold wallet can still be used on a separate device connected to the internet. This allows users to receive funds directly to a cold wallet without sacrificing any security.<br>Cold storage is more secure than hot storage because almost all malware is introduced to devices through the internet. However, this benefit comes with inferior convenience. Thus, cold storage should be used for large amounts of bitcoin that are not intended for day-to-day use. ||
|<a id=“コンセンサス“></a>コンセンサス |Consensus |Consensus is an ideal and the method of coordination between individuals in a decentralized system such as Bitcoin or other open source projects. Consensus is not a form of democracy: there are no forms of voting, representation, credentials, or gatekeeping involved in a consensus-based system. Nor does consensus require 100% agreement. Consensus is an ideal in the sense that, in most cases, there is no absolute agreement between all parties involved.<br>Consensus is required at multiple levels of Bitcoin: consensus must be achieved in maintaining the Bitcoin source code, and it must be maintained between all nodes storing and validating the blockchain. At the source code level, consensus is achieved by allowing anyone to propose, review, and comment on changes. This process is usually slower than centralized projects because discussion and review is applied intensively to any change before it is implemented. However, this process ensures that no special interests are served over others, and no private parties are capable of dictating Bitcoin’s future for their own gain.<br>At the blockchain level, consensus must be maintained by all nodes running compatible code. All nodes must agree on core parameters such as how many new bitcoin are created per block and what blocks and transactions are valid. Additionally, nodes must agree on the exact state of the network—which blocks comprise the blockchain and which transactions are included therein. If nodes disagree on these parameters, the network will fracture and the blockchain will splinter into several chains. Reconciliation between competing chains is extremely difficult, so maintaining consensus is of utmost importance. ||
|<a id=“カストディアル“></a>カストディアル |Custodial |A wallet or service is custodial if the user is not in control of their own private keys. For example, most exchanges and brokerages are custodial: they store the bitcoin and control the keys while showing the user their balance based on the company’s internal ledger.<br>Custodial wallets may have extremely high security, but they are also subject to government regulation and cannot be audited. A custodial service’s solvency or security practices cannot be proven by the average user. Likewise, if a user wants to send or receive bitcoin using a custodial service, they risk being censored or having their funds confiscated. For this reason, bitcoiners encourage one another to withdraw their bitcoin to a self-custodial solution. ||
