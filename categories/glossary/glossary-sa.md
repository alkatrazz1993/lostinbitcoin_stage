|<a id=“サトシ“></a>サトシ|  Satoshi  |  Satoshis, often abbreviated to “sats”, are the atomic unit of Bitcoin, named after Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. A single Bitcoin represents 100 million satoshis (1 BTC = 100,000,000 sats). Thus, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and there will only ever be 2.1 quadrillion sats. This feature makes Bitcoin more divisible, enabling payments smaller than $0.01 at current prices.In Bitcoin’s codebase, all values are actually denominated in satoshis, and the unit Bitcoin is only used by markets and those discussing Bitcoin. |  1,000 sats  |
|<a id=“サイファーパンク“></a>サイファーパンク |Cypherpunk |Cypherpunks are an unofficial and loosely connected group of individuals focused on building hardware and software to protect privacy and individual sovereignty. Cypherpunks are concerned with governments’ race towards a surveillance state as well as corporate domination of technology and intellectual property. Satoshi Nakamoto and nearly all of the original Bitcoin developers such as Hal Finney were cypherpunks.<br>As outlined in A Cypherpunk's Manifesto, cypherpunks generally believe in using cryptography and software rather than politics and advocacy to achieve freedom and privacy. This sentiment is summarized in the slogan “Cypherpunks write code”.||
|<a id=“サトシ・ナカモト“></a>サトシ・ナカモト |Satoshi Nakamoto |Satoshi Nakamoto is the anonymous creator(s) of Bitcoin who published the whitepaper on October 31, 2008 and mined the first Bitcoin block on January 3, 2009. Satoshi mined over 1 million BTC and developed the project in its early years before withdrawing and ultimately disappearing. Ever since, Satoshi has not moved any of this bitcoin.<br>Satoshi’s disappearance left Bitcoin without a central leader who could dictate the direction of the project, a source of strength in the eyes of most Bitcoiners.<br>The atomic unit of Bitcoin is the satoshi, in honor of Bitcoin’s founder.||
|<a id=“シュノア署名“></a>シュノア署名 |Schnorr Signature |Schnorr is a type of digital signature scheme similar to the ECDSA scheme used by Bitcoin since its inception. The Schnorr scheme presents several advantages over ECDSA, and is thus currently in the process of being implemented in Bitcoin via the Taproot upgrade.<br>Firstly, the Schnorr scheme is provably secure and non-malleable, two improvements over ECDSA. Secondly, compared to ECDSA signatures, Schnorr signatures take less time to verify. Schnorr signatures and public keys can be aggregated, meaning that multiple parties with unique private keys can sign the same message with much greater efficiency. Thanks to this feature, Schnorr signatures can be verified in batches instead of individually, further speeding up verification.<br>Key and signature aggregation also enable privacy gains by obscuring the number of signatures present on a transaction. Finally, Schnorr signatures are also smaller than ECDSA signatures, offering savings on fees for those spending Schnorr outputs.<br>When Bitcoin was invented, the Schnorr scheme was still patent-protected, and thus Satoshi Nakamoto decided to use ECDSA as the signature scheme for Bitcoin. The Schnorr patent has since expired, and Schnorr is currently in the process of being implemented in Bitcoin.||
