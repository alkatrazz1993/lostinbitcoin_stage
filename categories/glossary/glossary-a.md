|<a id=“adaptor_signature“></a>アダプター署名|  Adaptor Signature  |  An adaptor signature is an additional signature which is combined with an initial signature to reveal a secret piece of data. Adaptor signatures allow two parties to reveal two pieces of data to one another at the same time, which solves the trust problem involved in simultaneous transactions such as atomic swaps and coin swaps.The setup for an adaptor signature involves a secret value, an adaptor signature, and a “normal" signature. Knowing any two of these data is enough to calculate the third. A powerful feature of adaptor signatures is that one party can generate an adaptor signature based on a secret piece of data, and another party can generate their own adaptor signature based on the same data without actually knowing the data itself.As an example, Alice and Bob want to swap 1 BTC. First, Alice gives Bob an adaptor signature for an unsigned transaction sending 1 BTC to Bob. The adaptor is not a transaction signature, so the transaction cannot be spent yet, but it commits to a secret value.Next, Bob creates his transaction sending Alice 1 BTC. Using Alice’s adaptor signature, Bob can produce his own adaptor signature. This adaptor signature commits to the same secret value even though Bob doesn’t know the secret value. Bob shares both his transaction and his adaptor signature with Alice.Since Alice has both Bob’s adaptor signature and the secret value, she has enough information to produce Bob’s signature for his transaction, allowing her to claim her 1 BTC. As soon as Bob sees his signed transaction on the blockchain however, he can also calculate the secret value using his adaptor signature and his initial signature. From there, he can calculate Alice’s initial signature with the secret value and Alice’s adaptor signature. Bob can now sign Alice’s transaction and claim his 1 BTC.  |  21,000 sats  |
|<a id=“amp“></a>アトミック・マルチパス・ペイメント (AMP) |AMP | Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) is an implementation of the concept of Multipath Payments (MPP) on the Lightning Network.| |
|<a id=“address“></a>アドレス|  Address |  An address is used to receive bitcoin and is represented as a string of letters and numbers. Public keys and addresses are often conflated. An address is usually a hash of a public key, and at present, addresses, not public keys are used to directly receive bitcoin. On a technical level, an address can represent more than just the hash of a public key.A Bitcoin wallet allows users to generate as many addresses as they require. Wallets also allow users to send bitcoin to a provided address. When bitcoin is sent to an address, only the owner of the private key(s) which derived that address is capable of spending the bitcoin.Warning: avoid address reuse to protect your privacy. *It is considered a best practice never to reuse addresses. Every time you wish to receive bitcoin, you should use your wallet to generate a new address.* On a technical level, an address can represent several different scripts. Addresses are encoded and prefixed in order to convey their script type. Legacy addresses use Base58, and when a legacy address is the hash of a public key, a so-called P2PKH address, it begins with a ‘1’. Less frequently, a legacy address is a hash of a script, in which case it will begin with a ‘3’. Currently, all SegWit addresses are encoded in Bech32 and begin with the prefix ‘bc1’.When a user inputs an address into their wallet in order to send bitcoin to that address, the wallet examines the address type and constructs the appropriate script. This script, called the scriptPubKey, is appended to the amount being sent to the address. These two pieces of data—the amount and the scriptPubKey—form an output. |  10,000 sats  |
|<a id=“ibd“></a>イニシャル・ブロック・ダウンロード (IBD) |Initial Block Download (IBD) | Initial Block Download (IBD) is the process of building the full Bitcoin blockchain from scratch. When a new node is set up and joins the network, it connects to other nodes and asks them for blocks. The new node processes these blocks and builds the blockchain until it has caught up and is in sync with the network. Although blocks are being requested from individual nodes, the IBD process is trustless because a node can cross-check the data from different nodes and because of the nature of the blockchain’s Proof-of-Work chain. This process can take a few days or a few weeks depending on internet bandwidth and computer specifications. When beginning IBD, a node first gathers all of the block headers from other nodes and then requests each full block. This is done for increased efficiency and to allow users to begin using their node sooner. While building the blockchain block by block, a Bitcoin node also builds the UTXO set—the comprehensive list of all valid bitcoin. This set is updated with each block as the transactions in that block destroy and create UTXOs.| |
|<a id=“asic“></a>ASIC |ASIC |An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a special microchip built for exactly one purpose. Bitcoin ASIC miners, the hardware devices that contain these chips, are designed solely to hash blocks in order to find a valid Proof-of-Work. Essentially, the only function these microchips perform is the SHA-256 hash function on a block header. Because mining has become such a large industry, the difficulty has risen to the point where using a CPU or GPU to mine is no longer profitable. Having a single purpose affords ASIC miners critical efficiency gains in an industry where the tiniest efficiency improvement can give a miner the edge. The rapid innovation around Bitcoin ASICs has partially driven the explosion of hash rate over the last decade, bolstering Bitcoin’s security. | 
|<a id=“orphan_block“></a>オーファン・ブロック |Orphan Block | Bitcoin blocks are meant to be added every 10 minutes, but sometimes, two blocks can come in at similar times. One block may be sent to half of the network first, while the other block reaches the other half first. Nodes in the network keep both blocks since they are both valid. There are now two valid chains. However, as miners keep adding blocks, they will add them on top of one chain or the other. Eventually, one chain will become longer than the other, and all nodes will adopt the longest chain, abandoning the shorter one. This abandoned chain is a chain of orphan blocks. This orphaned chain is usually only one block long, but there is no limit to the number of blocks that can be orphaned through a reorganization or an extended period of uncertainty, where two valid chains are of equal length. Because this event causes significant financial detriment to the miner whose block was orphaned, it is important for the network to minimize orphaned blocks. This requires block propagation, the sending of blocks between nodes, to be as fast as possible. This is one reason why blocks are limited in size or weight.| |
|<a id=“off_chain“></a>オフチェーン |Off-Chain| Off-chain is a term used to describe any data that is not registered on the Bitcoin blockchain. Off-chain data can be Bitcoin transactions that were not sent to the blockchain, data on the Lightning Network, or data on other blockchains, such as a sidechain.| |
|<a id=“on_chain></a>オンチェーン |On-Chain | AOn-chain is a term used to describe any data that is registered on the Bitcoin blockchain, in contrast with off-chain data, which is not stored on the blockchain. On-chain data are always Bitcoin transactions, while off-chain data can be an unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction or any other type of data..| |
